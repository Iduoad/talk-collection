- AI & ML have been used and applied long before the hype and buzzwords were coined.
- Doing AI on the ground faces challenges that are different form doing AI for research proposes:
-- Setting the wrong metric for AI project value: what is the real ROI for AI teams?
-- Miscommunications around the actual problem to solve: Business VS Data Science points of view, affecting the problem to solve and the parameters to start with.
-- Business validation: (especially critical in financial services) This is different form AI validation, questioning the model assumptions, the explainability, the data privacy, the risks of deployment, ...
- Most of these obstacles aren't technical, they are organizational. And so are the possible solutions:
-- Cultivating AI awareness on the executive side of the project (recognizing a ML problem, recognizing what a Data scientist cannot do, ...)
-- Using Multidisciplinary teams: blending pure ML engineers with others types of profiles
-- Incorporate Design Thinking into the Delivery Model: minimizing the roadblocks of delivery via Forward Design.
" As a community ... ML is cool, let's do all the things around it well before the AI-winter ends up longer than it needs to be!"
